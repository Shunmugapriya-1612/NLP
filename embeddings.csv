9.159442,13.588415,5,"I echo that. When you have a place that you're proud of that you can go and say, This is such a beautiful field, let's all meet there, let's get toget"
8.537525,15.122675,7,"  I'm definitely going to take some time off again.  I took a couple days off before this event, spend it with family.  I'm turning 23 on Wednesday an"

7.999254,15.233004,7,"Yeah, it's a good question. I'm not the hiring authority, so I don't know, but I think it's important that we have really strong women in positions of"

7.9826946,15.470138,3,"I'm actually looking at him right now, he just walked in my office. We haven't talked yet. I'm going to find out his status. He's going to talk to you"

9.943595,11.795626,5,"Enjoy it. Honestly, it's stuff you gotta go through. I got a lot of advice from friends of mine. Kevin Cash, he's one of them. Something you gotta go "
6.0499077,12.4082575,5,"  Well, I don't know if that's true or what it is.  I think preparation and opportunity, those two things combine, good things happen."

9.534484,10.609399,4,I feel great right now.  What a beautiful day to play golf.  Braved the last two holes to kind of get myself back in the game.

9.435773,13.6041355,5,I'm living the dream. I know this is a big opportunity for me. It's a big year for me. And I'm going to do my best every outing and enjoy the time.
8.03211,13.96783,5,Feel really good.  I was just thinking like I don't want to discredit my round just because I played a couple bad holes towards the end of the day.
7.6036797,13.86659,8,"I thought we were disciplined. We weren't trying to do so much. I think when we've gone back and we watch how we defended her in the past, I thought i"
8.638168,15.07579,6,"  I mean, it definitely is a high percentage if I have a few days.  But like I said, I'm making some progress, then some days I'm the same.  We'll see"
8.183575,14.564998,2,Just I think my game just is finally coming together.  I'm really comfortable my swing.  My PXG equipment has been working fantastic for me.

10.772713,11.659101,5,I think everybody is excited about the game.  They have enjoyed their experience and they are going to be ready to play.
6.386409,14.190591,8,"I think you're always looking for pitching. I don't know that you ever have enough. I don't know. We'll see what's out there, see whatever. But like I"
9.983356,11.7175,5,"It's a little different than our old stadium, it's got some jagged edges around the outfield. It's going to take some time."
9.532973,12.284515,7, You probably are not going to see us two doing a Stance Little League Clinic.  We are probably the two worst guys you would want to have your kids go

11.094186,11.926573,6,We had three-hour training camp practice yesterday (laughing).  It's just prep.  Normal prep in between games.  Our guys are ready.

6.4410267,14.95652,4," I thought that if I play my best I know that there is a possibility to win, so it wasn't a big surprise for me."
8.043054,14.258443,2,"  Those guys do a great job.  I don't think the height is a key thing.  I think, again, we've just got to make plays."
9.081864,15.0236435,7,"The meetings will probably get longer because he won't get up and leave after he gets bored. Definitely lose some entertainment value, for sure. "
6.9188685,14.619846,1,"So a part of our tactics are bowling according to stumps, stump to stump. That's the field we employ. But we did not hit those lengths or those lines."
9.178057,13.265507,7," I've got a bunch of family in town, so I'll probably just be at home and entertain all of the family that I've got in town."

6.8521214,15.392597,7,"My opinion really doesn't matter, so I don't normally give it.  Say what I say, so I'm not going to give my opinion."
11.032817,13.045437,5,"Again, I think it brought us together, kind of similar to this game, like we're in this, and when we can turn it on, it's dangerous."
6.4147916,14.592649,4," It is not nice.  It is not nice.  It needs to be get better, everyone wants it to be better, but I don't think we have enough power, I don't think we"

9.039606,14.264489,2,"  I'm in great shape.  I bounce back extremely well in between games.  I could play right now if we had to play right now, at a high level."

10.533504,9.024957,4," Yes.  Birdie on 4, on 4 I hit a 3-wood off the tee and I hit a 6-iron in there about 12 feet just below the hole and made that for birdie."
9.161618,11.289057,2,"Well, I remember him hitting against me in Spring Training. And I would expect him to be looking for a fastball after the first at-bat."

6.929969,13.162364,2,I think just what I expect out of him.  I know he's a goal-scorer.  He scores lots of goals every year.  But there's a lot more to his game than that.
11.342796,12.6546755,4," Of course.  Yeah, to beat Becker in a Grand Slam that he won before, it is just great. Nothing compares to this, for sure."
7.4057317,14.126576,1," I don't think there will be an effect, because they have other players, as well.  So we can't just go in there saying, we have to play different, we'"
9.0980625,14.248613,5,"Yeah, it's just the game management, and you're expecting -- I'm not going to go all into it, but I have confidence, I had confidence in Kenley."
9.176332,12.1741905,4,"  Yeah, 100%.  I was not happy about that.  I was not happy.  But the bunkers are usually -- I like bunkers a lot so I just kind of went, No."

7.5955877,10.851703,2, I think she is a great player and she really puts a lot in the game on the court and off the court.  I hope she is still around for quite a few more 
10.695232,9.628477,4," It was only two feet wide.  First point he served for it.  It is a huge point, and it just pissed me off.  I had just got into it from there on."
10.433398,10.023394,2," Well, it is best she has played for a while.  She has a tendency to do that against me. Bad luck."
9.803889,10.885508,7,"For sure. I had a pretty good familiarity with the National League West, not just as the manager of the Giants, but also coming to play in the Nationa"
10.030063,11.671038,2,"Yeah, we stopped the bleeding last night and then came out and played well again today. We want to just keep it rolling."
8.524985,11.068238,3," Yes, I did.  And they did some work on it.  They gave me some medication and so on and so on.  But not good enough."
8.567837,10.195628,1,"We knew Ohio State was going to come out aggressive in that second half, just like they normally do.  We wanted to continue to be aggressive from our "

7.9341125,14.136613,4,"We can be better, period.  I thought we were good in front of them.  A couple of bad breakdowns we didn't capitalize on.  I thought we were solid in t"
11.465942,11.341191,7," Twice.  I played Tuesday, I was in the Pro Am, but before I got to here, I played Friday and Saturday, that was it."
7.899172,13.813706,8,"So they've got to qualify now to make it.  Every now and then that's going to happen, but it seems to be happening more and more in the Ryder Cup."
9.746006,12.233966,7,  This golf course is beautiful.  I've never been in area so it's a really pleasant surprise.  It's just so cool seeing all the boats.  People are act
11.097077,12.886181,5,"No, we try not to worry about any of that.  We just try to go out there and do our jobs and play."
9.68124,12.182607,7,"I think we've come a long way, as we have really over the course of decades.  I think the league is in a bigger, better, stronger place.  That starts "
8.670926,14.714033,7,It could be. I'm not a big room service guy. I like to go out and eat. Houston has got some pretty good restaurants that I like.
9.984015,9.417019,2," I think it is hardcourt.  I mean, even though he won his first Slam on the clay, I think hardcourt has had his best results."
8.696172,14.81712,7,I can share that I've been a fan of both players for a long time. I can share that in Philadelphia we thought about Kevin quite a bit. And we were fan
8.152188,15.015929,6,"  I mean, I'm doing everything what I can do.  It does feel better than when it happened.  But you know, we'll see.  I mean, I don't have no timetable"
6.4274273,12.994971,8,"  No, I've always been a guy who kind of let his game do the talking.  But when guys get to talking, I can do that, as well.  I've always tried to let"
10.733236,10.512004,8," We asked for a wildcard, three, four weeks ago, maybe.  I decided to play New Haven and Schenectady and here and asked for wildcards in all three."
10.610637,9.055693,4," You got off to a very fast start, two birdies in the first two holes, would you like to talk about that?"
8.59792,13.743554,4," I kind of enjoyed it.  I didn't enjoy the fourth set.  Did not enjoy that at all.  I enjoyed the match.  I enjoyed the first three sets, but I'd like"
7.986983,11.747504,7,"We have it on the outside of the case packs for our own uses that we know. That's part of the recommendation, is to better develop a tracking mechanis"
7.4963856,13.669659,4," Yeah, I think we start to play very nervous.  We didn't play so good today, but I think we have a great job in this tournament and I hope next year w"
10.047776,11.784031,5,"I echo everything. If we look too far ahead, we get lost. Even taking it one point at a time, we're not looking too far ahead or in the past, we're ju"
6.433416,13.140477,4,"Absolutely. That's what you call a perfect pitch right there, a pitcher's pitch. And I was able to lay it off. I thought it was a little off. I haven'"
6.565782,11.667321,2,"  Yeah, probably.  They have a deeper bench, there's no question and I think that gives them more of an advantage over the other National League clubs"
7.0493507,14.380561,8," I am not in her position.  I am in the other position.  I would probably continue, so, I don't know."
6.0170345,12.559882,2,"  Yeah.  I mean, that's who I am.  I know it doesn't seem like that all the time, but that's how I want to be on the court for this Team, be aggressiv"
8.094281,13.136494,2,"We talked about it right after that. These guys all season long, offense comes and goes, you have slumps, but when they're clicking on all cylinders, "
6.4860373,14.341397,5,I don't know the Team sentiment. We haven't really discussed it all that much. We're worried about winning a baseball game.
10.693778,10.409038,4,"Yeah, I think both Teams were pretty consistent throughout the match. Like hue said, Florida is a good Team, and not just people be consistent, but ju"
6.5100927,11.897198,7,Yes. He's been to many of the events that I've done in Puerto Rico. He helped support my academy in Puerto Rico. He's a very good friend.
7.344569,14.781589,1,"  A couple times.  She forced me into 3-wood a couple of times and it was a good move.  I wanted to hit driver and she's like, ""You can't do that."""
9.371362,10.89342,4,"Yeah, we were actually down 3 games to 1. We won the game in Chicago and then went to Cleveland and won the next two."
6.114961,13.052411,3,He's good. He's been swinging. I don't think he's hit live yet. He's hit off the tee. He says he feels good. Everything is healthy.
6.4076667,14.338254,7," I don't even know, maybe at the Bob Hope, and that's it.  Of course they have  thin air, as well.  At sea level I don't know."
10.2865305,10.656699,4," Most of the time you know it right away.  It is dramatic.  You win, you feel like you are on the top of the world and you lose and you feel like I am"
9.274785,13.707159,5,"He basically summed up everything.  It's just been an amazing three years for me.  Denver took me in as one of their own, and I can't thank them enoug"
8.55245,13.058889,2,"Those are pretty nice numbers for a middle, .484, 19 kills, eight blocks. And then got three aces, got some service. That's a pretty nice night."
6.311882,14.289455,2,Probably more.  It's his first Playoff.  He's a young guy.  We didn't know what to expect.  He's grown his game.
10.530811,13.4567,8,"Well, the three-batter minimum for me is a little cloudy, so I'm waiting to get some more clarification on it."
10.384826,11.520896,4," I wanted to come    I knew that the back nine would be hard to play, or harder, so I really wanted to make a good start, and I got it with the birdie"
7.2315464,14.657912,2,That's yet to be determined. I don't know if he played much baseball. We're going to find out just how much.
9.405677,9.8628645,3," I had no idea.  I mean, until he said-- until he went up to the umpire's chair I had no idea he was injured."
9.729873,10.9664755,5,"We are from a cricket crazy nation, so, yeah, people are expecting from us to win, and we are going also for the win actually."
8.110923,12.809409,6,"Just trying to get better. We've been fortunate to get to the Round of 8 the last couple years. That's kind of been our stopping point. For us, we're "
9.153658,10.200691,5,"It's tough having to think about different games, especially in the Playoffs.  I think we've done a good job as a group just taking games, putting the"
9.794891,11.697348,7,We're really excited to be here in Pittsburgh. We've enjoyed our time here. Been here since Monday. It's been really cool to be able to take a look at
6.644112,13.150195,2,"Yeah, I don't know if I came into his first year here shooting for 150. I think days off are important for players, period, of his age specifically, a"
6.2351575,14.06429,2," I don't know, he played okay, so good. I didn't have a lot of chances.  I was always behind.  I don't know, I think he played much better than me fir"
8.686726,10.641506,4,"A little bit, yeah. I think there's two different situations; one was with two outs, one was with one out. The one today I was trying to get the ball "
8.366223,14.859047,5,"  I'm blessed.  I'm blessed to be there.  I'm grateful.  But at the end of the day that's good and all, but I'm here trying to compete for something b"

10.237302,12.42755,1,I think all of his meetings are pretty similar.  It always ends with  Do the obvious things right.
9.6508665,9.415125,2,"Yeah, the innings started well and Javeria played well, and we had some more partnerships. I'm trying the best, and I tried to hit the ball and get th"
8.551976,9.776185,2,"Sevi is another guy that really improved his defense over the course of the year. Always a catch first, throw, bat second guy, and swung the bat well "
9.388038,11.123976,2," Well, if she -- it is hard to tell.  I mean, if she keeps playing as well as she does, maybe.  But you never know."
10.328824,11.506691,1,"For sure. Oh, yeah. Let me give you an example. I bring in Thomas Hardy to pitch the seventh inning."
9.318485,13.351696,7,"I've got some friends up here and my parents are driving up tonight.  My brother lives in D.C., so not too far away."
9.486095,10.563998,8,Absolutely not. Absolutely not. This is just a little thing that turned into a big thing that turned into a giant thing.
8.008736,14.442289,5,"  ""Don't lose.""  He was pretty simple about stuff like that.  The ball is in my hand and I have control of my own destiny tomorrow."
5.9293356,13.4036,4," I don't really know, you know, what was going through his head.  He played a good game to break me.  And then, you know, just didn't convert there.  "
9.730428,11.60387,6,"  We took some time off yesterday just to kind of get away from it a little bit, and we reconvened today, met, watched film, went over some stuff, pra"
10.371758,10.784991,7," Yeah, I kind of felt like you know, the crowd was for me and you know, it is a good feeling to have and to know that the crowd is there with you and "
6.523387,13.194778,2,"I agree, I think it's a great recognition for her and for her Teammates. Obviously you don't get to be a First Team All-American unless you've got som"
9.728995,13.909183,7,  Not very big.  We had three people living in one and two people in two other rooms.  I had a single which was about as big as this box I'm standing 
7.6314383,11.295417,5,"I think he does a good job of keeping himself in the mix.  He's that type of guy that, yeah, he's around now, comes out to the skates, hangs out with "
9.207274,10.904583,2, We have Karrie Webb here.  She comes into this tournament having won last week at Evian and in very good form considering she's won twice this year.
10.242236,11.121897,7,Absolutely.  It's exceeded our expectations.  When you get down here in this weather and the hospitality of Hillsborough County and Tampa people and t
8.988384,12.596568,1,Can we talk about that after a few cocktails? (Chuckles.) There was a lot of conversation about that three-batters. We've got a lot of managers still

10.102475,10.849628,5,I think the future is bright for this organization. I know Jeff is not only planning to be good for two or three years; he is planning for the Team to
8.031301,15.188182,5,"That's what you live for. For me, I need to get in my pregame routine right now, and that's where I'm at mentally, here we go."
9.283063,11.263102,7," I was sleeping also.  And taking a lot of showers, because you sweating just walking on the street.  I sweat.  Taking showers; then eat spaghetti and"
7.868631,11.965467,5,I just think it's going to be easier this year because I know the players so much and I know -- I'm familiar with a lot of guys.
6.299643,14.734304,2," I don't think so, no.  I wasn't very happy with my game today, so I don't know.  I didn't do anything better --"
11.422612,12.292682,7," Just have to read Brad Gilbert's book then you know everything.  You need to read his book, then you know everything."

10.3028,10.481861,6,I think we're going to come out tomorrow and try to apply pressure. When we play our best baseball we apply pressure.
6.451375,14.765457,7,"Yeah, but to what extent, we didn't know to what extent. But, yeah, we were trying to take some precautions, yes."
8.067872,15.498856,3,  I'm not going to get into all of those because I don't know all of them.  I'll just be in there at the end.  But that's the training staff and our d
10.28517,10.8259325,4,"Yeah. Actually, we think the first one is edge, but unfortunately, we lost the review, and the second one is out, I think, but we lost the review."
6.727305,15.037826,1,  I don't know that Will is going to be able to help us do anything when we're sitting eighth.  That's just the way it goes.
9.662615,10.695308,2,Am I a fan? I love it when my pitchers get three hitters out in a row. I think that's the greatest thing in the world. How do you like that answer?
7.1281033,11.380568,4,"National championship over everything.  This is an amazing experience.  We really came out today, and I feel like we played all four quarters, and tha"
9.969985,9.416861,4,"If you were to use this week's current rankings, pre British Open, and apply the new 35 divisor, I believe Michelle would now be ranked seventh."
6.885311,15.001634,2,"I think everybody needs a little bit of confidence. You can't go out there not having any. If it's your day, it's your day. You have to cash in."
6.688291,11.385,2,He's extremely smart. He can move the ball around. He changes speeds from 90-plus to 70 and below. That's not easy to do. That's not easy to face.
10.491712,9.946131,2,"It's just a great group of guys and they played so well, and they were just flying all over, and that was a very good offense.  It was just a treat to"
8.597821,10.24697,5,I think it helps our players knowing that they got a chance to play here for a couple of days. They know the environment. They know the field. And I t
7.587818,15.295061,7,"That's an inside joke. Tommy and I have spoken a lot, as much as anybody I've spoken with has been Tommy. Well, I will get to everybody."
8.6059065,14.06184,4,"  I don't think ever in a major  -- to be in contention, I don't think we've ever been in the final group on the last day."
6.8028436,15.260385,8, You don't deserve to take my money.  I deserve to take your money because I help you do your job.

8.622249,13.602729,2," When I first hit it, I had no idea whether it was going to go out, but once it goes out, it's a pretty special feeling.  I've never hit a walk-off ho"
7.9654503,15.547887,7," That's true.  I'm always afraid I'm going to get shot because somebody thinks I'm Brad.  I need a sign on my back that says I'm Bart, don't shoot me."
11.707087,11.976441,5,It's the first time we've ever achieved that in our 27-year history.  Obviously we're excluding the time when we were the sole manufacturer.
7.934367,15.435276,5,"I'm just looking forward to work with these kids again. That's my mindset. I'm very lucky to have the Team that I have. What's the oldest guy, Anthony"
5.8946857,14.234374,5,"Yeah.  It's like -- I mean, the goal is to get back and win it, though.  We're not satisfied with getting here.  But definitely just to get back here,"
8.978463,10.42416,5,  No one on this Team cares about Individual awards.  Not something that anyone needs to be concerned about.  That's the ultimate goal.  That's what w

9.160623,14.680625,5,"I hope so. I hope so. I'm AOK with being the underdog. Kind of been there for most of my career. I've fine with that, doesn't bother me a bit. "
6.1949377,12.4950485,2,"Well, that line, when they're all together, they have great chemistry for sure.  That line will be more effective, I would assume, with Barbashev back"
8.89133,12.011722,5,"Through text chains, different things like that.  We obviously see him when we're at home.  Chris Wagner has been on the road with us, he's been able "
8.476846,11.718561,1,"Yeah, I think especially early on, being in their building, it's something that we can certainly do.  It's going to be effective.  It worked for us he"
8.457027,10.039328,4,"  We approach every game with that mindset.  We want to be the Team that gets the first loose ball, makes the first physicality play, makes the first "
10.985202,10.709505,1,"  We have Batista listed on the bullpen card today, but it is strictly in an emergency situation that he would be used out there."
6.9745965,14.830454,7,  After I came into the room and I saw today I didn't know if it was me seeing him or him lying down on that bench there.
10.286657,11.697095,7,"I found out from Alex Bregman, by the way, which is part of the story. I forget to answer the first part of your question. Go ahead."
8.696511,14.749592,4,I'm not too sure what really happened.  It just happened so fast.  But the officials did a tremendous job in our game.  So I trust the decision made b
9.800703,9.350491,4, It broke left to right and at the end it came back and it was coming back right to left at the end and it ended up going in right in the middle.
9.316744,10.893525,7,"At what point does she stop becoming the transfer from Michigan? That was three years ago. She's Tiffany Clark, Wisconsin Badger."
8.308115,14.305959,4, It is the same.  It is fast.  Just fast.  You can't say it is two miles slower or something.  It is just fast.
10.5290575,9.224354,4,"On the 10th tee I put it in the rough but made a bogey there, but on the next hole I made a birdie, and I think that was the key hole maybe."
8.368857,14.102791,2,"I thought I did fine. I don't know, I'm just playing to win. I guess that's the key to my performance."

6.076362,12.462513,2,"Yeah, I don't know if they're really slowing him down.  I think he's getting looks.  He's just not scoring.  Rask is playing well, that's for sure, ma"
8.066535,10.516071,5,"We trust our players here. You hear a lot of people like me sit up here and say that, We trust our players, and give them the opportunity."
8.873284,9.755123,1,"Yeah, the coaches always emphasise on bowling on the right place and right spot and right length and line and length."
5.933795,12.715914,5,"That's a tough call. I haven't even looked at schedule yet, but I know we play good baseball, and we got to stay healthy, but I think we're better tha"

6.5203414,11.881434,2," Well, sure she's a great player.  She has been at the top before, and, you know, she knows how to win and, you know, there is no question.  I think s"
10.068103,9.801621,1,It's just tactically just to break the momentum because she was getting bat on ball and just to slow the game down for us as well.
9.581913,9.817123,7," Yeah, first time.  Sometimes they defaulted at the beginning of the tournament, but not beginning so close to the quarterfinals or semifinals.  It is"
7.593846,11.967817,7,"  Yeah, it's actually a good influx of really good people.  It will just help on the engineering side of things.  Obviously you've got a bigger crew t"
11.053932,12.845134,7,"  I happy to be in that position.  I am not thinking about if I am surprised or not.  I am very, very happy."

7.1761904,11.742803,2," Yeah, I mean, I worked also a lot my physical, so I know I have now maybe one of the best also."
8.095822,10.3913965,2,"No, that's where the ball went. As soon as I try to premeditate, I usually lose my wicket. So I have a saying, see ball hit ball, and that's something"
6.2333646,12.501502,2,"Yeah, of course it's a worry. I think any Team worries when their senior players aren't performing. Obviously there are things that we can go back and"
10.517871,10.015793,1,"That is extremely important for us in offense.  To be as successful as we need to be, we need to have both parts of our game going, and, you know, Jan"
8.040428,14.971024,1,"I'm not sure what the answer to that question is. The most direct and easiest way to answer is probably to win more baseball games, and how many more?"
10.236687,12.278959,7," Well, what can you do when you have a rain like that?  There is not much you can do and when you want to stick to the schedule, it is what you try to"
11.390507,12.620858,7,I put that out of my mind a long time ago.  I could have sat in my den a lot of times and gotten mad at Trey for that ridiculous drop on Sunday.
10.436499,11.536739,4,Do you want to go through the birdies first and then he can make some comments?  You started on 10 and you birdied 11.

5.8944106,13.482689,4,"  Yeah, unfortunately I didn't hit that great of a shot on 11.  I feel like I executed my game plan, but we didn't carry it far enough for it to take "

6.31965,14.226071,7," I don't know, I signed the ball for a kid, so he might have had it because it was the same number.  Could have been that ball, I don't know."
10.41691,9.291263,4,"  Honestly, today's round was a little bit boring.  I had 16 pars going into my last two holes, and pars are good, but they can be frustrating if you "
9.657917,10.916798,2,"It's been huge. And like I said, everybody talks about our big three, but AnÃ»?bal has pitched unbelievable since he came off the aisle all year long."
10.574581,12.237535,2,Status is still the same.  He went through the film session and that was the bulk of what we did.  Status is the same with Goran.

8.278316,13.954018,1,I don't get caught up in that.  I go out ask there and get myself prepared to play a big game and worry about winning.

10.544978,9.484678,2,I think she passed over 2-4 and made zero hitting errors and she did a really nice job. She had a tough matchup there in the last two sets against Sam

9.448917,11.548421,4," At times, no.  At times, yes.  Depends on the player, depends on the day.  As far as today, I think that I just definitely went for too much at times"
6.894322,12.412926,2,"  Well, she's going to get better open looks in this series than she did in the last series, so that's a positive, number one."

7.111797,14.919909,6,I personally don't think so. I don't think it's one point or two points that determine anything. It's going to sting just as much.

7.698951,11.602478,6,"Yeah, I mean, there's probably not going to be a lot of odd-man rushes.  We know that.  It's been a tight series.  Not a lot of room out there."

6.7840247,15.417065,2,I don't think there was one thing that I helped him with.  I think Andre is probably giving more credit to me than I deserve.

10.458017,11.172773,4,I would say it was very close to maximum.  But not 100%.  I would say it was very close to maximum.  Maybe you can write for which paper you work for.

6.4004264,11.869983,6,"Well, there's been times where that does happen, for sure.  We respond pretty well to adversity.  When it's on the line, we tend to get good results. "

7.863907,14.826793,7," Well, I was on the Nationwide Tour for five years after college, and I've been close a few times.  But I wasn't able to make it out here."
8.348001,15.205005,7,"Yeah, I guess I haven't really thought about it too much. But I'm sure I'll probably push it back a little bit."
8.281518,15.251282,6,"Yeah, I've never been to the SCG. I've seen it all on TV in the Ashes when I was younger, so it's quite nice to be able to go there and play a game th"

10.123595,9.504474,1,  It's a huge deal.  It's the switch of a game.  Could be the change of an outcome.  It's key.  We knew that going in we're going to have to close out
10.331471,12.225206,7,"  It's been a good time.  I got a chance to enjoy the city a little bit for a couple of days, look around.  And again, it's been business at hand."
10.544809,8.982859,7,It's a Taylor Made Rossa putter.  I putted with a Rossa earlier in the year.  I'm going back and forth with it and I grabbed it one out of the barrel 
9.916307,10.738026,5,I think so too. We kept learning as we went. That was the biggest thing. We were just taking it one day at a time and doing whatever we could to just

9.145452,11.914188,5,"Yeah, I use that as a lot of motivation personally. I love it. Honestly, like, if people want to motivate me, just talk crap about me on the Internet."
6.1757402,13.88515,4,"We actually hit some balls hard, we really did. We just can't get nothing going these last three days. But we hit some balls hard."
10.187073,9.662279,4,"Execute.  Last night was a lot better, simplified getting pucks to the net, got some traffic.  We had some pretty good looks.  I probably should have "
10.641253,9.159601,4,"  Pretty tough start.  You know, like actually 1st hole I make bogey I feel like it's can happen because like long par-4."
